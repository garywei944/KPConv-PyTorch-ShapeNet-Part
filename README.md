3D Part Segmentation on PartNet

Apply KPConv (Kernel point convolution) for the task of shape segmentation based on the PartNet dataset

## TODO
- Get PartNet dataset from https://shapenet.org/download/parts
- script to load dataset
- Model architecture (maybe focus on just the rigid one for now)
- train / evaluation code
- experiments to achieve the same performance presented in the paper
- write up report in latex
