3D Part Segmentation on PartNet


Apply KPConv (Kernel point convolution) for the task of shape segmentation based on the PartNet dataset

TODOs:
 - Get PartNet dataset from https://shapenet.org/download/parts 
 - script to load dataset
 - Model architecture (maybe focus on just the rigid one for now)
 - train / evaluation code
 - experiments to achieve the same performance presented in the paper
 - write up report in latex
